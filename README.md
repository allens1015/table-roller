# table-roller
Basic loot roller for PF1e built in Perl

--o=potions sets the origin table to start rolling in- use the filenames inside /data
--ic=# sets the initial number of loot items
--v=### sets the max gold value of the loot you're going to generate

This is missing several types of wondrous items- shoulders, neck, wrist, untyped- so --o=wondrous_items will die every other attempt
